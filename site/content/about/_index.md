      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on
      an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of
      relationships between organisms and their environment. What
      grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and
      careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
      coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
      farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
      grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
      coffee farming on our blog.
