      We believe that every resident of the BCP should feel huge pride in being a member of the community, and have a strong desire to show and share that pride at every opportunity. Through collaborative, cohesive and coordinated projects we aim to make this a reality.

    text: >
      At Crimson we feel very strongly that for the BCP to thrive it must have a strong and resilient economy. This means spreading the load properly amongst more than a handful of industries, and proactively supporting businesses to grow and thrive. Our projects are completely geared towards this principal.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing
      coffee to you. That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into
      farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is
      grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about
      coffee farming on our blog.
